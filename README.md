Welcome to the Stepper Form Challenge! This project showcases my ability to build a dynamic and interactive form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I successfully completed this challenge and received appreciation for my work. This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and highlights its potential.

## Features

- **Stepper Form**: The form is divided into multiple steps, guiding users through the input process. Each step focuses on a specific set of fields, providing a clear and intuitive user experience.

- **Validation**: The form includes client-side validation to ensure that users provide valid input. Error messages are displayed if any fields are incomplete or contain invalid data, allowing users to correct their input before proceeding to the next step.

- **Progress Indicator**: A progress indicator dynamically updates as users navigate through the form, indicating their progress and the current step.

- **Responsive Design**: The form is built with a responsive design, ensuring that it displays and functions properly on different devices and screen sizes.
